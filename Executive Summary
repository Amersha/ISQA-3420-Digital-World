Executive Summary

  Nebraska Business Training was started by two corporate trainers who decided to provide value quality training
  to employees of small and large firms. They provide onsite and online training depending on the convenience of
  the employee. The topics of training range from technical MS office products to non-technical training such as
  team building, avoiding workplace harassment. Every employee in a workplace should not only have technical knowledge
  but should also know basic workplace ethics. These training classes were managed by two office assistants
  and were mostly managed manually. But as the company grew and more customers started to flow in the manual management
  of all the training classes were getting hectic and the customers also preferred having a self-service option which would
  help them save time and energy. The two assistants enter the details like training description, cost for training
  and the schedule of the training manually into the website. To make the tasks simpler Nebraska Business Training 
  has contacted the Trustworthy Computing Services.
